# CS 245 (Spring 2019) Practice Assignment 09

I am not sure why but my heap sort ended up becoming false at around the 15th to 20th time it was added and removed from the heap array, i tried all i could to fix it and looked at many different ways to implement the shiftdown and delete but it would not seem to work and other times it would give me a null pointer error, i dont think there was anothying wroing with my growing array function so i am not sure what went wrong, besides that it worked fine. hopefully you can point me in the right direction once you grade it, thanks!
